          We at TipiAI know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.  <strong> By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways. </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that your use of TipiAI’s Services is at all times subject to the <a href="/eula">End User License Agreement and Terms of Use (“EULA”).</a>  Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the <a href="/eula">EULA</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage.  We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with the provision of our Services, to allow you to set up a user account, to contact you, to fulfill your requests for our products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from or about anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from or about a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@tipiai.com">hello@tipiai.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Will TipiAI ever change this Privacy Policy?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We update and improve our Services from time to time, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the TipiAI website or via the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them.  If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.  Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>What Information does TipiAI Collect?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.  For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, and payment information.  Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.  Please note that TipiAI cannot monitor the content of any Licensee Materials to determine whether they contain information that would qualify as Personal Information.  Although it is TipiAI’ policy not to use or disclose Licensee Materials except as necessary to offer the Services to you, TipiAI cannot, and does not assume any obligation to, de-identify or remove any such information before such License Materials are processed in connection with the Services.  Accordingly,
          We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you information about our products and features of the service that are available to you.  If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by sending an email to <a href="mailto:hello@tipiai.com">hello@tipiai.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.  You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use this data to provide a better experience for you while you use the Services, such as by remembering your login information, if you’ve chosen to remain logged in after ending your session.  We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>Will TipiAI Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone.  We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Information that’s been de-identified.</strong> We may provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services. However, we never disclose aggregate usage information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Agents:</strong> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we (or substantially all of our assets related to the Services) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, we may share and/or transfer Personal Information as one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. The terms of this privacy policy will continue to apply to your Personal Information even after such transfer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Protection of TipiAI and Others:</strong> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our <a href="/eula">EULA</a> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of TipiAI, our employees, our users, or others.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not share your Personal Information with third parties to enable direct marketing purposes. However, under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to contact us to prevent disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes; in order to submit such a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@tipiai.com">hello@tipiai.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>Is Personal Information about me secure?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.  You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
          We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, no provider can guarantee complete security.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information. However, we’ve taken measures, including encryption of your License Materials, to limit the impact of any such factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>What Personal Information can I access?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          Through your account settings, you may change your name, email address and password. The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change.  If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@tipiai.com">hello@tipiai.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>What choices do I have?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.
          You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above.  When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.
          When you terminate your Account with us, your License Materials will be removed from the Services, but removal may not happen right away and some information may remain in our records, logs or automatic backups after your deletion of such information from your account. We may continue to use aggregated usage data after your stop using the Services, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h5>What if I have questions about this policy?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to <a href="mailto:hello@tipiai.com">hello@tipiai.com</a>, and we will try to resolve your concerns.
